Where: ** the space (Elzenstraat 4A) **

**Adience:** 
Anyone who is interested

**Prerequisites:**
None. 
If you want you can bring a digital design (gerber) of a circuit board that you would like to make. I cannot guanrantee that we have time to make all.

**Topic:**
DIY printed circuit board fabrication. I have recently spent some time to develop the procedure to make printed circuit boards at home. This evening I will walk you through the steps involved. It will be a bit like an interactive walk-through. 

If other people are more experienced with etching (or even completely different methods of pcb fabricarion) I would love to experiment with that as well during the workshop. Maybe we can compare results/pros/cons. 

There is some more info on my procedure [this other wiki page](/pcbmilling)
