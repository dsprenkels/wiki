# Hackerspace Nijmegen Wiki

## how to contribute to this wiki

 - send your ssh public key to stef
 - wait for confirmation
 - `git clone wiki@wiki.hackerspacenijmegen.nl:wiki`

then start contributing away.

alternatively you might want to send PRs to our read-only github mirror:
https://github.com/hackerspace-nijmegen/wiki - which can be merged manually by
those who have sent ssh keys to stef. But note that this takes longer as
manual processing is manual processin.

don't forget regularly remind other people: "it's a wiki"

thanks.
