Knitting Machine to laptop

There you go. My objective for the rest of the year is getting my knitting 
machine connected to my laptop (serial to usb), so i can create and replace the 
knitting patterns and create new ones. 

Ultimately, the idea is to knit bitmaps.

Model: Brother KH-930e.

It works but the electronics are old.

Next steps: 
* create the serial to usb cable
* install stuff (python)

First encounter to the matter was [Electro-knit
Hacking the Brother KH-930e knitting machine](https://learn.adafruit.com/electroknit/software)

Specs and updates will follow.
