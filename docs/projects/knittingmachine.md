There you go. My objective for the rest of the year is getting my knitting 
machine connected to my laptop (serial to usb), so i can create and replace the 
knitting patterns and create new ones. 

Ultimately, the idea is to knit bitmaps.

Model: Brother KH-930e.

Steps: 
* create the serial to usb cable
* install stuff

First encounter to the matter was https://learn.adafruit.com/electroknit/software

Specs and updates will follow.
