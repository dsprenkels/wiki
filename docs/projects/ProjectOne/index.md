## Idea:
Hack together on a semi-large project because hacking together is much more fun than hacking alone.
Plus, I had some funky ideas for projects that are simply too large to face on my own.

I am hoping to collect a small team of people and collaborative work on one of these because hacking is more fun when done together.
The list is not exhaustive and the ideas are open to suggestions and refinement.
