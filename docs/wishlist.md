# Wishlish for the new space

If it's not on the list doesn't mean we don't want it. Please get in touch ;-)

This is just a brainstorm, not all of these can be bought or donated, some need to be produced (such as space telemetry). Not all of these are a strict requirment to operate the space from the beginning but some are pretty essential.

Please add missing information. E.g., how many would be needed? put your name after the item if you can get one.

#### Furniture
* trashbin
* Couches (3?)
* workbench
* working table (laptop height)
* chairs for the above
* storage racks/shelves
* big fat red flashing donation box
* accent lighting and spot lighting (I believe we have tl in the ceiling for flood lighting?)
* blinds or curtains


#### Apparel
* fridge
* coffee machine
* kettle
* cups for the above
* microwave oven
* large flatscreen or beamer for presentations
* music installation
* network switch and cabes
* digital access control mechanism (key fobs, rfid reader and solenoid cylinder, the latter twice to access both doors?)
* space telemetry (open/closed status, spacecam?)
* space server. (for space telemetry, spacenet ldap, revbank, rfid door stuff will probably all require at least some on-site infrastructure)
* 2d printer
* soldering equipment
* scope/logic analyzer
* tools (hammer, hacksaw, pliers, calipers, etc.)
* consumables (resistors, transistors, leds, nodemcu's, arduino's, etc.)
* 

#### Decorations
* posters
* stickers
* character incresing hackery elements
* plants? if we dare...
* outward facing sign like an led-banner?
