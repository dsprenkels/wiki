# Wishlish for the new space

If it's not on the list doesn't mean we don't want it. Please get in touch ;-)

This is just a brainstorm, not all of these can be bought or donated, some need to be produced (such as space telemetry). Not all of these are a strict requirment to operate the space from the beginning but some are pretty essential.

Please add missing information. E.g., how many would be needed? put your name after the item if you can get one.
