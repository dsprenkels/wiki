(it was originally 3rd April 17:00 UTC+0100 but then stupid daylight savings
came in)

plesase look at this spreadsheet:

and create a ranking of your favorite names. either one name per line in order
of *decreasing* preference, or as a json list of names in a similar order.

you can do so until: 3rd April 17:00 UTC+0200

for the evaluation of the votes we use the schulze method:
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method) as it is being used by projects
such as the debian, gentoo, pirate party, fsfe and others.

## Nominations Phase

we have currently 112 suggestions. we should hurry up with choosing a name if
we don't have one by the time we have our opening party the generic
hackerspacenijmegen will stick. to facilitate a quick and fair selection we
should stop making new suggestions on the above quoted ethercalc sheet by 28th
March 17:00 UTC+0100. this is the nominations deadline.

## Voting Phase

With the end of the **Nominations Phase** we move onto the second stage, the
voting of our name. for this we use the widely used Schulze method
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method) as it is being used by projects
such as the debian, gentoo, pirate party, fsfe and others.

### Eligible Voters
who is eligible for voting, anyone on the list of people contributing to our
monthly costs, the mailing list and on our irc channel. (this is open to
debate)

### How to Vote
how to vote, send a mail to me (may be we'll have a better voting box than
this by that time) after the deadline of phase 1 (nominations) and
before the voting deadline of 3rd April 17:00 UTC+0100 with a ranking of your
favorite names.

### What Is A Ranking?

A ranking is an ordered list of names starting with the most preferred in
decreasing order of preference. you can also have multiple names at the same
preference, in this case write the names separated in one line. you do not
have to list all names from the ethercalc sheet, all omitted names are
considered least preferred without any order among these.

if you want to help making this as easy as possible for us to evaluate, send
the ranking as a json list of lists:
```
   [ ['most prefered name1', 'similarly ranked #1 name'],
     ['2nd ranked name'],
     ['3rd ranked name'], 
     ....
     ['last ranked name']]
```

### Publishing of Votes

we will publish all votes anonymously on the wiki, where you can verify that
your vote is included and that the schulze method has been applied correctly.

We will publish the results of the final tally asap.
